What are you doing here? Looking at documentation for this crazy library? :tongue_sticking_out:

Unfortunately, you won't find any Getting Started guides, but you'll find some other things:

- The [Motivation](docs/motivation.md) for building this library
- The [Interfaces](docs/interface.md) for generating and modifcying objects
- The syntax for making [Queries](docs/query.md) into objects
- A short [Reference](docs/reference.md) containing some relevant environment variables
